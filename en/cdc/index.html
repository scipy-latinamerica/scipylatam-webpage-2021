<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>

<p>When taking a personal report, with your agreement, the staff members may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. This report will remain private.</p>
<p>During this private chat, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.</p>
<p>We value your attendance.</p>
<h1>Anonymous report</h1>

<p>We can’t follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence</p>

<p>Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.</p>
